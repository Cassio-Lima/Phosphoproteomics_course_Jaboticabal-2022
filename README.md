# Phosphoproteomics - From sampling to data analysis
## Introduction

Phosphoproteomics is a branch of proteomics that aims to identify, catalogue, and characterize proteins containing a phosphate group as a posttranslational modification (PTM). Hence, the modification of proteins with removal or addition of one or multiple phosphate groups is highly dynamic. In plants, protein phosphorylation regulates many biological processes including plant growth, development, immunity and is affected by multiple enviromental stimulus. 

This course takes the audience through sampling process, preparation, data acquisition and data analysis. It's target audience is researchers with various research backgrounds and different levels of expertise in the field. 

TThe entire content of the course was developed by the Functional Phosphoproteomics lab at the VIB-UGent Center for [Plant Systems Biology](https://www.psb.ugent.be/index.php/groups/functional_phosphoproteomics) and makes use of software and methods already published by other labs.

## Course Program

The course lasts 3 days with two sections per day. More detailed info available in [Course Program](https://cassio-lima.github.io/Phosphoproteomics_course_Jaboticabal-2022/course_program)

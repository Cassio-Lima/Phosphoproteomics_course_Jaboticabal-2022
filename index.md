# Phosphoproteomics - From sampling to data analysis
## Introduction

Phosphoproteomics is a branch of proteomics that aim to identify, catalogue, and characterize proteins containing a phosphate group as a posttranslational modification (PTM). Hence, the modification of proteins with removal or addition of one or multiple phosphate groups is highly dynamic. In plants, protein phosphorylation regulates many biological processes including plant growth, development, immunity and is affected by multiple enviromental stimulus. 

This course takes the audience through sampling process, preparation, data acquisition and data analysis. It's target audience is researchers with various research backgrounds and different levels of expertise in the field. 

TThe entire content of the course was developed by the Functional Phosphoproteomics lab at the VIB-UGent Center for [Plant Systems Biology](https://www.psb.ugent.be/index.php/groups/functional_phosphoproteomics) and makes use of software and methods already published by other labs.

## Course Program

The course lasts 3 days with two sections per day. More detailed info available in [Course Program](https://cassio-lima.github.io/Phosphoproteomics_course_Jaboticabal-2022/course_program)

## Getting Started

Every day of training we will provide slides together with extra course materials if needed. Additionally, the course was designed to be interactive with a *Hands-on* section starting from **Day 2**

### Software

Currently, a pletora of programs are available for analysis of proteomics data analysis. However, MaxQuant is one of the most popular because it is easy to use, offers functionalities for nearly all kinds of proteomics data analysis challenges and it's free. The software is maintaned by the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry (MPI) and receives updates regularly. 

You can download MaxQuant [here](https://www.maxquant.org/maxquant/)

Additionally, the Perseus program handles most output files from MaxQuant and assists the analysis.

Both programs with their graphical user interfaces (GUI) are only currently available for Windows Operating Systems, althougth MaxQuant can run in UNIX enviroment with assistance of Mono/DotNet.

# Phosphoproteomics - From sampling to data analysis
## Introduction

Phosphoproteomics is a branch of proteomics that identifies, catalogs, and characterizes proteins containing a phosphate group as a posttranslational modification (PTM). Hence, the modification of proteins with removal or addition of one or multiple phosphate groups is highly dynamic. In plants, protein phosphorylation regulates many plant processes including plant growth, development, immunity and is affected by multiple enviromental stimulus. 

This course takes the audience through sampling process, preparation, basics of Mass Spectrometry and posterior Data Analysis. It aims to attendees with multiple research backgrounds and different levels of expertise in the field. 

The course was developed by the lab of Functional Phosphoproteomics lab, at Plant Systems Biology (VIB).

## Course Program

The course is aimed to last 3 days with two sections per day. More detailed info available in [Course Program](https://cassio-lima.github.io/Phosphoproteomics_course_Jaboticabal-2022/course_program))

### Programs

Currently, a pletora of programs are available for analysis of proteomics data analysis; however, MaxQuant is one of the most popular because it is easy to use, offers functionalities for nearly all kinds of proteomics data analysis challenges and it's free. The software is maintaned by the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry (MPI) and receives updates regularly. 

You can download MaxQuant [here](https://www.maxquant.org/maxquant/)

Additionally, the Perseus program handles most output files from MaxQuant and assists the analysis.

Both programs with their graphical user interfaces (GUI) are only currently available for Windows Operating Systems, althougth MaxQuant can run in UNIX enviroment with assistance of Mono.

# Phosphoproteomics - From sampling to data analysis
## Introduction

Phosphoproteomics is a branch of proteomics that identifies, catalogs, and characterizes proteins containing a phosphate group as a posttranslational modification (PTM). Hence, the modification of proteins with removal or addition of one or multiple phosphate groups is highly dynamic. In plants, protein phosphorylation regulates many plant processes including plant growth, development, immunity and is affected by multiple enviromental stimulus. 

This course takes the audience through sampling process, preparation, basics of Mass Spectrometry and posterior Data Analysis. It aims to attendees with multiple research backgrounds and different levels of expertise in the field. 

The course was developed by the lab of Functional Phosphoproteomics lab, at Plant Systems Biology (VIB).

## Course Program

The course is aimed to last 3 days with two sections per day. More detailed info available in [Course Program](https://cassio-lima.github.io/Phosphoproteomics_course_Jaboticabal-2022/course_program))

## Getting Started

Every day of training we will provide slides for you to follow and basic quiz. Additionally, course was designed to be interactive with a *Hands-on* section starting from **Day 2**
